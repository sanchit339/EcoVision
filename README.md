# EcoVision
EcoVision is a web application that provides real-time and future predictions of air pollution data. It utilizes data from data sources to display pollutant concentrations for different cities and offers forecasting capabilities using time series analysis.

**Steps to run it locally on your machine.**

(I have used Windows Powershell, some commands may where. Please look for specific commands for your OS)

**Step 1**: Open Windows PowerShell/Command Prompt on your device.

**Step 2**: Download Python and make sure pip is installed.
        To check if installed successfully,
        
        command for python check : python --version
        
        command for pip check : pip -- version

If both commands show their respective versions, python and pip installed successfully.

**Step 3**: Download virtual environment to keep the versioning of dependencies of project limited to that project. This way, you can create different projects with different versions of dependencies.

        Command: pip install virtualenv
        
**Step 4**: Create virtual environement

        command: virtualenv <env_name>
        Eg. virtualenv v1
        
**Step 5**: Activate virtual environment

Go to the location where your virtual environment is created.

        Windows-
              command: <env_name>/Scripts/activate
        Linux/macOS-
              command: source <env_name>/bin/activate
              
**Step 6**: Clone the repository
        
        command: git clone https://github.com/TANISHA-P/EcoVision.git
        
**Step 7**: cd the location where the repository is cloned. You'll find a directory named 'EcoVision'

        command: cd EcoVision
                 pip install -r requirements.txt
        (It may take some time to install)
        
To check for all installed requirements:

        command: pip list
**Step 8**: Run the development server
        command: python manage.py runserver
This starts the development server. 

Once it starts, you'll see a line 'Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/'. 

Copy the url(http://127.0.0.1:8000/). 

Paste it in the browser and append '/home' to it.

        Final url = http://127.0.0.1:8000/home
    
Press Enter. 

The website is running on local server under debug mode. All the debug data can be seen on PowerShell.
